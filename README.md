## Vector Database Tutorial!
Let's use SingleStore as a vector database and see how to store embeddings and retrieve them whenever needed. 

[Sign up to SingleStore database](https://www.singlestore.com/cloud-trial/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pavan&utm_term=AV&utm_content=VECTRDB) to use it as a vector database.

We will get a publicly available data, convert that data into chunks, embed the chunks, store them in vector database and retrieve the data with semantic & hybrid search.
